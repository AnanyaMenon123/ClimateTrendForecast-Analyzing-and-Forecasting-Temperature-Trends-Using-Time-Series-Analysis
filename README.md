# ClimateTrendForecast-Analyzing-and-Forecasting-Temperature-Trends-Using-Time-Series-Analysis

The project involved analyzing and forecasting historical temperature data using Time Series Analysis techniques. The dataset, representing average temperatures over several decades, was preprocessed to address trends and seasonality. Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation functions were employed to determine suitable parameters for a Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. After splitting the data into training and test sets, the SARIMA model was fitted and evaluated. The model's performance was assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), yielding insight into the accuracy of temperature predictions. Ultimately, the project aimed to showcase the application of time series forecasting methods for climate-related datasets.
